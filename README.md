# Rugged Rover - A Work in Progress

**Rugged Rover** is a ROS 2-based autonomous mobile robot platform designed to run on the Lynxmotion A4WD3 Rugged Wheeled Rover.

---

## Features

- ROS 2 `ros2_control` integration with custom hardware interface for Sabertooth motor drivers
- Differential drive controller with 4-wheel support
- Encoder feedback and velocity control via Teensy 4.1 + micro-ROS
- Teleoperation via Logitech joystick or keyboard (TODO)
- Realistic URDF + RViz visualization (Currently Basic)
- Launch system for hardware and simulation
- Modular packages for control, description, and hardware
